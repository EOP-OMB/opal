The technologies can also be configured to allow the execution of signed mobile code while simultaneously blocking the execution of unsigned mobile code. \nCategory 1B technologies cannot differentiate between signed and unsigned mobile code or cannot be configured to block the execution of unsigned mobile code while enabling the execution of signed mobile code. \n\nCategory 1 mobile code must be obtained from a trusted source and must be signed with an approved PKI code-signing certificate.\nTo the extent possible, all information system components capable of executing mobile code must be configured to disable the execution of unsigned Category 1 mobile code.\nCategory 2\u00a0- medium risk mobile code technologies have full functionality, allowing mediated or controlled access to workstations, servers, and remote system services and resources. Category 2 technologies can pose a moderate security threat to\u00a0information systems because they offer limited control by the user on what the code is allowed to do. \nCategory 2 mobile code may be used if it is obtained from a trusted source over an assured channel (i.e., TLS VPN, IPsec, or other approved by the ESRMO).\nUnsigned Category 2 code, whether or not obtained from a trusted source over an assured channel, may be used if it executes in a constrained environment without access to local system and network resources (e.g., file system, Windows registry, or network connections other than to its originating host).\nWhere possible, web browsers and other mobile code-enabled products must be configured to prompt the user prior to the execution of Category 2 code.\nWhere possible, protections against malicious Category 2 technologies must be employed at end user systems and at system boundaries.\nCategory 3\u00a0- low risk mobile code technologies support limited functionality, with no capability for unmediated access to workstation, server, and remote system services and resources. Category 3 technologies pose limited risk to information systems because they are very restricted in the actions they can perform. \nEmerging mobile code\u00a0- all mobile code technologies, systems, platforms, or languages whose capabilities and threat level have not yet undergone a risk assessment and therefore have not been assigned to one of the three risk categories described above.", "remarks": "", "control_statement_responsible_roles": [], "properties": [], "links": [], "annotations": []}}, {"model": "ssp.control_statement", "pk": 414, "fields": {"control_statement_id": "Part b", "control_statement_text": "Category 1A mobile code technologies may be used\u00a0when additional restrictions are implemented.
