Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented\n               by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the\n               information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the\n               requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring\n               administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny\n               by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner,\n               or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and\n               privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\n               attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes\n               required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,\n               day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations\n               consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)\n               and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer\n               requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider\n               these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\n               accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\n               accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for\n               short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\n               Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with\n               the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may\n               bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are\n               not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\n               for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are\n               unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic\n               disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts\n               include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no\n               longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.

While user\n                  identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change\n                  more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational\n                  needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the\n                  immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users\n                  terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic\n                  privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of\n                  users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles.

The policy is\n                  bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed\n                  outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure\n                  that the constraints on the information remain in effect).

Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges\n                  relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational\n                  mission/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is some policy\n                  mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a\n                  policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and some users of the\n                  information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified\n                  information resident in the information system.

Thus,\n                  while AC-3 (3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information\n                  to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits\n                  the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n                  The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is\n                  passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be\n                  required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect.

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping\n               export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet,\n               blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting\n               web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and\n               limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\n               content. Transferring information between information systems representing different\n               security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers\n               violate one or more domain security policies.

Flow\n               control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information\n               path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\n               gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or\n               establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a\n               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering\n               capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\n               document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\n               filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)\n               that are critical to information flow enforcement.

Internal data structures can represent different types of\n               entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are\n               typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of\n               individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with\n               data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and\n               communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions\n               representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities\n               with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with\n               active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive\n               information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information\n               system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e.,\n               objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes\n               to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of\n               setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to\n               data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access\n               control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or\n               information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of\n               security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access\n               organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed\n               for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is\n               potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security\n               attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not\n               releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and\n               values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful\n               and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security\n               attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within\n               organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of\n               information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access\n               authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),\n               nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in\n               accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers\n               to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to\n               enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The\n               AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association\n               (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements including\n               information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes\n               include, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access\n               authorization) level for subjects.

External information systems include, for example: (i) personally\n               owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets,\n               personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications\n               devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,\n               convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or\n               controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information\n               systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and\n               authority of organizations.

For some external information systems (i.e., information systems\n               operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those\n               agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those\n               organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms\n               and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not\n               be considered external.

Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,\n               contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational\n               information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules\n               of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\n               authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending\n               upon the trust relationships between organizations.

Audit events can\n               include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to\n               information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or\n               third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,\n               organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to\n               be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs,\n               this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are\n               audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that\n               information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful\n               and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances\n               due to the potential burden on system performance.

Organizations also include auditable events that are required\n               by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and\n               standards.

This control\n               applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and\n               documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group\n               authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique\n               identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or\n               for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,\n               tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\n               authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information\n               systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\n               access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf\n               of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of\n               networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\n               processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network\n               connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that\n               involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal\n               networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\n               encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between\n               organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be\n               treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality\n               and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the\n               identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the\n               requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the\n               specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the\n               use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are\n               defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number\n               [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token);\n               or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require\n               devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,\n               hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\n               cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD\n               common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the\n               information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification\n               and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide\n               increased information security.

Establishing,\n               developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline\n               configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and\n               maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the\n               information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for\n               Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to\n               support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is\n               primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that\n               organizations develop an information security architecture for the information\n               system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to\n               the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security\n               architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information\n               technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used\n               internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is\n               complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\n               information systems or information system components to external entities, and there\n               is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization\u2019s enterprise\n               architecture and information security architecture."}}, {"model": "ssp.nist_control_statement", "pk": 1928, "fields": {"control_id": "pl-8", "statement_type": "objective", "statement_text": "Determine if the organization: <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(a) develops an information security architecture for the information system that\n                  describes:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(a)(1) the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to\n                     protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational\n                     information;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(a)(2) how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the\n                     enterprise architecture;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(a)(3) any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external\n                     services;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(b) <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(b)[1] defines the frequency to review and update the information security\n                     architecture;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(b)[2] reviews and updates the information security architecture with the\n                     organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise\n                     architecture;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(c) ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected\n                  in:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(c)[1] the security plan;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(c)[2] the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS); and<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PL-8(c)[3] the organizational procurements/acquisitions."}}, {"model": "ssp.nist_control_statement", "pk": 1929, "fields": {"control_id": "pl-8", "statement_type": "assessment", "statement_text": "Organizational processes for developing, reviewing, and updating the information\n                  security architecture\\n\\nautomated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the development, review, and\n                  update of the information security architecture"}}, {"model": "ssp.nist_control_statement", "pk": 1930, "fields": {"control_id": "pl-8.1", "statement_type": "statement", "statement_text": "The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth\n                  approach that:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Allocates {{ pl-8.1_prm_1 }} to {{ pl-8.1_prm_2 }}; and<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and\n                     mutually reinforcing manner."}}, {"model": "ssp.nist_control_statement", "pk": 1931, "fields": {"control_id": "pl-8.1", "statement_type": "guidance", "statement_text": "Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural, technical,\n                  or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome\n                  multiple safeguards to achieve their objective.

Such\n                  relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities\n                  participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and\n                  levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases,\n                  the degree of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are\n                  able to exert on external service providers with regard to employment of security\n                  controls necessary for the protection of the service/information and the evidence\n                  brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is\n                  typically established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or\n                  service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating\n                  contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to\n                  very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain\n                  commodity services such as commercial telecommunications services). In other\n                  cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince organizations that\n                  required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control\n                  effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information\n                  system services provided to organizations through well-established business\n                  relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable\n                  risk range of the organizations using the services. External service providers may\n                  also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the trust\n                  relationship more difficult and complicated to manage.

Trustworthy\n               information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within\n               defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and\n               purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of\n               operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors\n               affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security\n               functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed\n               within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance\n               (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its\n               application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational\n               information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for\n               example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous\n               hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security\n               engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of\n               assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is also based on the\n               assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical\n               missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated\n               assurance requirements for such systems.

The monitoring objectives may\n               guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\n               achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection\n               systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning\n               tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software).

Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to\n               capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period\n               of time, a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful.
