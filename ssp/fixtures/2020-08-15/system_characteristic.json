[{"model": "ssp.system_characteristic", "pk": 1, "fields": {"system_name": "MAX.gov Shared Services", "system_short_name": "MAX.gov", "system_description": "<p>MAX.gov Shared Services -commonly just MAX.gov- is a suite of Software as a Service (SaaS) capabilities used by federal agencies and thier partners.&nbsp; MAX.gov offers a suite of web based tools for collaboration, information sharing, data collection, publishing, and data analisys. The MAX.gov tools are all integrated by a single sign on soluion and have many APIs which allow information to flow from one tool to another. However, each tool is a completly seperate application with it's own authorization solution to enforce access retrictions to user data. In this sense the MAX.gov suite of tools is very similar to Microsft Office. Mutiple tools with some overlapping capabilities designed to work well together but with seperate design and architecture defaults to support the most common work flows for that specific tool.</p>\r\n<h4>Historical Context</h4>\r\n<p>MAX.gov was originally the name given to OMB's Budget information systems which provide the tools necessary for producing the President&rsquo;s annual Budget, overseeing agency execution of appropriations, and performing a wide range of data collection, tracking, modeling, analysis, presentation, reporting, and publishing activities to support informed decision-making and good governance year-round. The data managed in puruit of these missions is highly sensitive and unauthorized disclosure of this information can have very seriouse real world consequences on both the economy and the political capital of the administration. The data is also highly compartmentalized and requires a very granular authorization structure that must be consistently enforced across mutiple applications operating on the same data. The OMB Budget systems were developed, operated, and maintained by the OMB Budget Systems Branch and required the expenditure of considerable resoures each year to maintain and improve these critical systems.</p>\r\n<p>In 2006, the Budget LoB was launched to provide modern, interoperable, flexible, cost effective and optimized solutions supporting all phases of the formulation and execution of the Federal Budget and linking budget formulation, execution, planning, performance, and financial information. The U.S. Department of Education was selected as the Managing Partner, supporting the goals of the Budget LoB.&nbsp; The new tools would be built using the existing platform offered by OMB's Budget information systems which already included a robust and highly secure infrastructure and authentication layer. The new systems would focus on collaboration, data collection and analytics. The new tools would be developed from the ground up to support collaboration with mutiple agencies or components as well as non-federal partners including State, Local, and Tribal government users as well as private sector users such as contractors or NGOs. . The new systems would be refered to as MAX.gov Shared Services and the existing MAX.gov systems became the MAX.gov Budget Systems.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next few years the number and variety of MAX.gov Shared Service applications grew exponentially, as did the adoption of these tools by agencies.&nbsp; Use of these information systems spread rapidly beyond the budget offices to support a wide range of important agency missions. As a platform operated by the federal government for the exclusive use of Federal agencies MAX.gov Shared Services filled a specific need for many programs.&nbsp; In 2014 MAX.gov Shared Services became one of the first FedRAMP Authorized cloud service providers offering both a PaaS and SaaS service. In 2018 MAX.gov discontinued the PaaS offering and rearchitected the existing Shared Services.&nbsp; The new system represented a significnat change in many areas and it was decided to create an entirely new SaaS offering on FedRAMP for the new MAX.gov Shared Services SaaS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The MAX.gov team at OMB provides technical and program management support for the shared services provided through the Budget LoB. On behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, GSA manages the shared procurements that fund these shared services. Other agencies may voluntarily participate in the Budget LoB and obtain shared services through a funding or in-kind contribution. All participating agencies govern the Budget LoB through the Budget Officers Advisory Council.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Stipulations on use of the MAX.gov Shared Service platform</h4>\r\n<p>MAX.gov Shared Services tools are available to any federal agency in any branch of the federal government (Executive, Legislative, or Judicial). Federal agencies may use the MAX.gov tools for internal activities where access is restricted to only users from the sponsering agency or for external activities where access can be granted to users of other agencies as well as non-federal partners including State, Local, and Tribal government users as well as private sector users such as contractors or NGOs. that are working with the agency.</p>\r\n<p>All activities hosted on MAX.gov Shared Services must be sponsered by a federal agency. This sponsorship is documented by an MOU which defines the agency's responsabilities for supporting the secure and lawful use of the MAX.gov platform. Agencies are responsable for any data processed or stored by MAX.gov in support of a sponsored activity. The agency is responsable for responding to Freedom of Information Act Requests or subpoenas regarding data for any sponsored activities. MAX.gov will forward any such request to the agency and provide technical support as needed to assist the agency in responding. Agencies must also ensure that any federal records processed or stored by MAX.gov in support of a sponsored activity are properly handled in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration schedules approved for the sponsoring agency.</p>\r\n<h4>Retention and Management of Federal Records</h4>\r\n<p>The sponsering agency is responsible for managing records in accordance with thier own policies and procedures. MAX.gov retains records for a minimum of seven (7) years unless otherwise instructed by the sponsoring agency. If the sponsoring agency has a records retention schedule which differs from our default practice, then MAX.gov will work with the Records Management POC to accommodate their needs. MAX.gov may request reimbursement for any additional costs to comply with an agency&rsquo;s specific records retention schedule.</p>\r\n<h4>Agency Authorization to Operate (ATO) or Use (ATU)</h4>\r\n<p>MAX.gov is registered with FedRAMP as an Agency Authorized SaaS cloud service provider (CSP). MAX.gov's posiion as a federally operated service means that our approach to ensuring the confidentiality, accessability, and integrity of agency's data differs in some ways from the processes employed by commercial CSPs. Every agency using MAX.gov Shared Services is responsible for arranging for their own Authority to Operate (ATO) in accordance with their own and FedRAMP policies.&nbsp; Agencies may also issue an Authority to Use as described in NIST SP 800-37 r2. A sponsoring agency may leverage information from the MAX.gov FedRAMP package to assist in making their own ATOor ATU determination. The MAX.gov ATO signed on November 1, 2018 by the OMB Authorizing Official (AO) Kelly Kinneen, Assistant Director for Budget, and authorizes OMB to use MAX.gov to process and store information at the FISMA and FedRAMP Moderate level. Sponsoring agencies are also responsible for ensuring that usage of MAX.gov complies with MAX.gov usage policies (<a href=\"go.max.gov/policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">go.max.gov/policies</a>).&nbsp;</p>", "date_authorized": null, "security_sensitivity_level": "", "security_objective_confidentiality": "", "security_objective_integrity": "", "security_objective_availability": "", "system_status": 5, "remarks": "", "authorization_boundary_diagram": 1, "network_architecture_diagram": 1, "data_flow_diagram": 2, "properties": [], "annotations": [], "links": [6, 8, 48, 202], "system_information": [], "leveraged_authorizations": []}}, {"model": "ssp.system_characteristic", "pk": 2, "fields": {"system_name": "Office of Managemnt and Budget Infrastructure", "system_short_name": "OMB IaaS", "system_description": "<p>The Office of Managemnt and Budget maintains a secure infrastructure layer which provides the foundation for all OMB hosted applications.&nbsp; The OMB IaaS includes the following components:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Secure data center facilities provided by the White House Information Technology (WHIT) Organization.
