This configuration minimizes the risk of lateral movement between business systems in the event of a compromise. System level firewalls should be enabled allowing only data flows that relate to the purpose of the system, to prevent connections that will violate this policy.\nApplication Layer\nAt the application layer, each application should be configured to enforce access only to specific systems on specific ports.\u00a0 If possible, data transfers should be limited to specific data formats (XML, JSON, text, etc.).\nIf required, the application must be explicitly configured to utilize the proxy server as the gateway that provides inbound and outbound connections to the internet.\nApplications are required to document connections that move beyond the system boundary.\nThe information system manages information flow based on the information system boundary.\u00a0\nImportant Considerations\nThe system must enforce information flow control using protected processing domains (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decision.\nSystem must be configured to prevent encrypted data from bypassing content-checking mechanisms.\nSystem must enforce defined limitations on the embedding of data types.\nSystem must enforce information flow control on metadata (monitor communications that occur within the system).\nSystem will enforce the use of human review for system security when the system does not perform as expected.\u00a0\nThe information system must be configured to identify and validate sources and destinations of information transfer.\nThe system must create labels for data to differentiate between system specific components and individuals involved in preparing, sending, and receiving information.", "properties": [], "annotations": [], "links": [], "control_statement_responsible_roles": []}}, {"model": "ssp.control_statement", "fields": {"uuid": "ff268655-28d9-451b-9797-9cd29208a409", "title": "ac-4.21 Physical / Logical Separation of Information Flows - Part a", "short_name": "ac-4.21 Part a", "desc": "", "remarks": "", "control_statement_id": "Part a", "control_statement_text": "Lateral movement must be managed when possible by information flow enforcement at the point of origin, destination and at least one other inline device.
