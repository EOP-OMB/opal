Impacts to some information and information systems associated with security management may affect the security of some critical infrastructure elements and key national assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities).&nbsp; Impact levels associated with security information directly relate to the potential threat to human life associated with the asset(s) being protected (e.g., consequences to the public of terrorist access to dams or nuclear power plants). The following recommended categorization of the security management information type is subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}</p>\r\n<p>Confidentiality</p>\r\n<p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security management information on the ability of responsible organizations to physically protect their personnel, assets, and facilities.&nbsp; The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most security management information depend on the likelihood that the information might jeopardize the physical security of an organization&rsquo;s assets and the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Information associated with the physical security of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate a major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from Federal detention facilities, theft of commodities market projections, access to information associated with a felony criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing facilities and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated with major procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties, access to currency printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or bullion storage facilities).&nbsp; In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.&nbsp; Unauthorized disclosure of one agency&rsquo;s security management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on crossjurisdictional coordination within the security management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The consequences of physical protection failures at most Federal facilities are more likely to result in serious<a href=\"applewebdata://2A775B64-8B73-43F5-B1D3-4ECE9E7A9AA6#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> adverse effects. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:&nbsp; Information associated with security management at other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people.&nbsp; Examples of more potentially damaging information includes information that reveals specific measures for protecting government aircraft, information that might permit access that creates an opportunity to bomb a government building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.), and leadership protection details that could result in assassination opportunities.&nbsp; In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be <strong><em>high</em></strong>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unauthorized disclosure of security management information that can be reasonably expected to pose a serious threat to human life (including those of security guards) must also be assigned a <strong><em>high</em></strong> confidentiality impact.&nbsp; [Security management information associated with some Federal government assets is classified.&nbsp; The classified information is <em>national security related </em>and is outside the scope of this guideline.]&nbsp; Other security management information, such as that affecting Nuclear Regulatory Commission &ldquo;SAFEGUARDS&rdquo; or Internal Revenue Service &ldquo;Limited For Official Use Only&rdquo; information is not <em>national security information</em>, but must be treated as having <strong><em>high </em></strong>confidentiality impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level:&nbsp; The confidentiality impact level recommended for most security management information is <strong><em>moderate</em></strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Integrity</p>\r\n<p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.&nbsp; The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of security management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used.&nbsp; In cases of intrusion indications, security management information can be time-critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical security management information can reasonably be expected to result in physical security vulnerabilities.

The IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause lawsuits against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the Service, and public distrust of the Service&rsquo;s ability to protect such information &ndash; all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with tax laws.&nbsp; It notes that unauthorized release of information such as the name and address of an informant (in cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person&rsquo;s life.<a href=\"applewebdata://502D71DB-93D2-4EEF-8580-391B34D1A919#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as information that requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information.&nbsp; Sensitive information includes information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp; The IRS OUO guideline notes that prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal matters, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency rules and regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security.&nbsp;
