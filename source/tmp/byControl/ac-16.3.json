The integrity of specific items, such as security configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring mechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from \u201cknown good\u201d baselines. Automated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions, information flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions."
